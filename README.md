# What is it?
This repo is part of a challenge from Code Education. The goal is to make a docker image that uses Golang and when executed it prints a message, try it out!

Well, I know that in first place it does not sound challenging at all, but there is a catch: the image must have less than **2MB** of size

## How to run it:

> docker run victorthury/codeeducation

If you want to check if the size is less than 2MB, run:
> docker images victorthury/codeeducation
